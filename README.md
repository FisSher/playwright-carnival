# playwright-carnival
Repo that I did with coworkers while teaching them playwright with typescript. Now I will keep updating and enhancing it with my own ideas while I keep a separate one for them.

The idea of the repo is to show playwright and other skills in order to solve issues. Also show how I structure the code.

# What do I need? 
Node 20.x.x

# How to run
Clone the project

run "npm install" 

run npx playwright test

# Good to have
VSCode playwright extension
